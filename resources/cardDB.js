	meaning:'x',
	meaningrev:'y',
	history:'In the decks before Waite-Smith, the Fool is almost always unnumbered. There are a few exceptions: some old decks (including the 15th-century Sola Busca) labelled the card with a "0", and the 18th-century Belgian decks labelled the Fool as "XXII".[6] The Fool is almost always completely apart from the sequence of trumps in the historic decks. Still, there is historic precedent for regarding it as the lowest trump and as the highest trump.Traditionally, the Major Arcana in Tarot cards are numbered with Roman numerals. The Fool is numbered with the zero, one of the Arabic numerals.',
	interpretation:'In many esoteric systems of interpretation, the Fool is usually interpreted as the protagonist of a story, and the Major Arcana is the path the Fool takes through the great mysteries of life and the main human archetypes. This path is known traditionally in cartomancy as the "Fool\'s Journey", and is frequently used to introduce the meaning of Major Arcana cards to beginners.',

	name: "The Magician",
	image: imagePath + "maj01" + ".jpg",
	meaning:'x',
	meaningrev:'y',
	history:'In French Le Bateleur, "the mountebank" or the "sleight of hand artist", is a practitioner of stage magic. The Italian tradition calls him Il Bagatto or Il Bagatello. The Mantegna Tarocchi image that would seem to correspond with the Magician is labeled Artixano, the Artisan; he is the second lowest in the series, outranking only the Beggar. Visually the 18th-century woodcuts reflect earlier iconic representations, and can be compared to the free artistic renditions in the 15th-century hand-painted tarots made for the Visconti and Sforza families. In the painted cards attributed to Bonifacio Bembo, the Magician appears to be playing with cups and balls. In esoteric decks, occultists, starting with Oswald Wirth, turned Le Bateleur from a mountebank into a magus. The curves of the magician\'s hat brim in the Marseilles image are similar to the esoteric deck\'s mathematical sign of infinity. Similarly, other symbols were added. The essentials are that the magician has set up a temporary table outdoors, to display items that represent the suits of the Minor Arcana: Cups, Coins, Swords (as knives). The fourth, the baton (Clubs) he holds in his hand. The baton later stands for a literal magician\'s "wand". The illustration of the Tarot card "The Magician" from the Rider-Waite tarot deck was developed by A. E. Waite for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1910. Waite\'s magician features the infinity symbol over his head, and an ouroboros belt, both symbolizing eternity. The figure stands among a garden of flowers, to imply the manifestation and cultivation of desires. Waite was a key figure in the development of modern Tarot interpretation, though not all interpretations follow his theology.',
	interpretation:'When the Magician appears in a spread, it points to the talents, capabilities and resources at the querent\'s disposal. Depending on the card\'s placement in relation to other cards, the message is to tap into one\'s full potential rather than holding back, especially when there is a need to transform something. There are choices and directions to take. Guidance can arrive through one\'s own intuition or in the form of someone who brings about change or transformation. The card can mean that a manipulator is floating around, usually if it\'s reversed. He may be a beneficent guide, but he does not necessarily have our best interests in mind. He may also represent the querentâ€™s ego or self-awareness. He can also represent the intoxication of power, both good and bad.According to Arthur Edward Waite, this card signifies the divine motive in man.[10] It is also the unity of the individual being on all planes, and in a very high sense it is thought. With further reference to the "sign of life", i.e. the infinity symbol and its connection with the number 8, it may be remembered that Christian Gnosticism speaks of rebirth in Christ as a change "unto the Ogdoad." The mystic number is termed Jerusalem above, the Land flowing with Milk and Honey, the Holy Spirit and the Land of the Lord. According to Martinism, 8 is the number of Christ.',
